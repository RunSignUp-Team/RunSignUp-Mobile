RunSignUp-Mobile Timer
======================

RunSignup Mobile Timer is a mobile application that allows three users to time and place a race in real time. It does this through integration with RunSignup.com, and requires a Race Director account.


Roadmap
1. Cleanup, signing in to RunSignup (downloading race list)
2. Work on archiving data (JSON, update on lostconnection->Regained connection)
3. Push data up to server (time field, bib # field, place field).


Different features to implement:
Bluetooth enabled phones to send to master device (one of the three timers)
