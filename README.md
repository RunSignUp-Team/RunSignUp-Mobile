RunSignUp-Mobile Timer
======================

Roadmap
1. Cleanup, signing in to RunSignup (downloading race list) (Andrew+Stephen)
2. Work on archiving data (JSON, update on lostconnection->Regained connection)
3. Push data up to server (time field, bib # field, place field).


Different features to implement
Implement big record button in other two views
Barcode scanner for Chute
Setting for Checkers enter bib first or time first
Archive JSON for offline
Archived JSONs viewer
Expand timer from min->hours real time.
Send whole race list to update server every time (200 people * (time+place+bib))
Bluetooth enabled phones to send to master device (one of the three timers)
